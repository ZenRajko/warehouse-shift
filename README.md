# Warehouse Shift: A Stacking Game

*** WORK IN PROGRESS ***

### Premise

You own a warehouse stacked with crates. 
Customers request specific crates which often have other crates on top of them, forcing you to shift crates between stacks to get to the desired one.

Additionally, the crates are either wooden or metal, and these materials will set limits on how crates can be stacked - not yet implemented.

### Ideas

* Difficulty levels to be added. In higher levels, crates are added to the warehouse as you work, or perhaps a time limit.
* Draw a truck pulling up outside the warehouse to pick up the crates.
* Special crates, e.g. fragile ones, where nothing can be stacked on top of them.
* Still to add animations of crates being moved.
